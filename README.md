A Magic2Snes script to view your position in Croctopus Chase (4-4) of Donkey Kong Country. Works with anything supported by QUsb2Snes.

## how to use
- for routing / learning / practice purposes only. **not intended for use in actual speedruns.**
- radar will automatically scroll vertically, based off the average position between diddy and the camera.
- you can hide/unhide the yellow + orange zones from LeadOstrich's tutorial by **left-clicking**.
- you can unlock the camera by **double clicking**. pan by dragging with the left mouse button. zoom using the scroll wheel.
- radar will show you:
  - the camera's position (large white box)
  - object 1's (typically donkey) position (small yellow square)
  - object 2's (typically diddy) position (small red square, with crosshair)
  - object 3's (typically expresso) position (small white square)
- avoid resizing / moving the window. for reasons unkown to me, it often makes the app freeze.

## how to install
- if you haven't already, download and install the latest QUsb2Snes - https://skarsnik.github.io/QUsb2snes/
